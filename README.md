# TradingScripts

This repo contains some trading models I made to predict Bitcoin prices during hour long trading windows from June 2021 - January 2021. My machine learning algorithm was able to achieve a 15% return.

This repo includes 3 files: 

* [.RMD file](https://github.com/ng4567/TradingScripts/blob/master/DFi-labs-final-version.Rmd) which contains the R code used to make the algorithm
* [.html file](https://github.com/ng4567/TradingScripts/blob/master/DFi-labs-final-version.html) Knitted version of the .RMD, can be used to see results and graphs without having to run code
* [.ipynb file)(https://github.com/ng4567/TradingScripts/blob/master/DFi-labs-final-version.ipynb) Jupyter notebook for those who prefer to run code in that envrionment
